# TGVE/REG meeting 7 Jan 2022

## Project questions

- how does TGVE compare to Kepler?

## Dev questions

- why does Dockerfile run `plumber::plumb()` rather than `geoplumber::gp_plumb()`?
- DEV_URL vs PRD_URL
- is this just a warning? old-style crs object detected; please recreate object with a recent sf::st_crs()
- can run front-end via `yarn start` (but this is front-end only?) -- what's the difference when we run with geoplumber?
- docs say to modify PRD_URL but in the JS code, seems to be DEV_URL as well -- can we just modify process.env.NODE_ENV?
