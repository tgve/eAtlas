## Introduction

> this was prepared prior to speaking to REG colleagues.

Extract from funding bid\'s \"Goals\" section: \"This proposal is specifically aimed at (1) taking the Beta release of the TGVE to stable release. As secondary aims we will (2) continue to develop, test and evaluate innovate visual approaches for spatial analysis that are grounded in academic theory and best practice and (3) engage with research teams (both within the Turing and beyond) to increase the
uptake of the TGVE."

In the "Delivery plan" section of the document we also have "...involvement of Turing REG in months 6-8 where the stability of the software and utility to the user will be stress tested." This is what
this document is prepared for. As we have not done this before, and if the Turing colleagues have done similar work before, we are happy to rewrite this document and work with their method/workflow.

## REG sprints

We propose the following specific steps in the **primary section** of the table to be the starting point of the sprints by our REG colleagues:

|  Sprint no| Are of TGVE| Description          | Est. Duration (days)|
| --------  | -----------|----------------------|--------|
|  1 | Npm package  | Overall stress test?      | 3
|  2 | Npm package  |  Security?                | 5
|  3 | Npm package  | General code-review?      | 3
|  4 | Npm package  | Docs and code comment review |5
|  5 | TGVE instance use of URLS | Feedback, Security paradigm etc |  2
|  6 | The ecosystem and the github organisation | Feedback and better code arrangement? |  1
|  7 | Github.com/tgve/tgvejs  |  Manage repository source code |   1


### Primary sprints for REG collaboration

| Sprint no| Are of TGVE | Description                  | Est. Duration |
|----------|----------   | ---------------------------- | ---------|
| a   | Npm package        | Modular architecture design. I have been struggling with this for months now. This would make the TGVE a truly OS community driven application and stand it out for years to come as a Modular Turing Geovis Engine. Any directions to other research or corporate/developer teams around the world is welcome  |      ?   |
| b   |                    |                              |           |
