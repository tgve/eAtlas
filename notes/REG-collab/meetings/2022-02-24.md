  * Attempt to work out remaining week's work: had a long meeting and identified which area to focus on.
  * odd tickets/issues to fix/todo
  * tgvejs docs space/choice still to pick
* Submission to EuroVIS
* AIUK provisional space.
  * RevealJS slides?
  * datasets? Is geospenser.com and saferactive enough?
  * anything else?

Notes:
* (1) Is there a Turing Way of doing docs for npm packages? ReadTheDocs (Python?)
* (3)
  ** Nick: talked to Will about a demo to data journalists.
  ** Nik: booth would not be interactive. What example would be good? That is the key Q.
  ** Crash Data still the best.
  ** Layik: combine datasets (geo + csv)
  ** Nick: ideal would be users bringing their own data. Interactive session that we can get them to visualize their data. Comms team do not have a concrete plan and are open to suggestions.c
