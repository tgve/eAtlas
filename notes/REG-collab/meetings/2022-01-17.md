## Dev questions

- what is the divergence between `master` and `npm` and how to resolve?
- what is the development workflow on the `npm` branch? (instructions for `master` don't work)
  - `docker build` can't find `webpack/lib/node/NodeTemplatePlugin`
  - `yarn start` can't find `index.html`
- if `README.md` is generated from `README.Rmd`, what is the build step?
- what GitHub workflow (if any) captures the dependency of `tgveR` on `npm-tgver`? (can we surface the dependency on the Plotly commit?)
