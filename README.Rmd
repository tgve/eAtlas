# eAtlas &middot; [![Node CI](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Node+CI%22) [![Publish Docker image](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/actions/workflows/docker.yml) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/eatlas.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/eatlas)

The Turing Geovisualisation Engine (TGVE or eAtlas) is a web-based, interactive visual analytics tool for geospatial data analysis, built using R & React. The visual views and interaction mechanisms designed into the tool is underpinned by empirically-informed guidelines around visualization design and techniques from Geographic Information Science (GIScience). 

## Using eAtlas
Current documentation is based on Wiki entries in this repository. There are two template repositories within the `tgve` organisation here on GitHub: `eatlas-template` and `full-template`. The former is setup so that data scientists and developers can deploy their own instances easily and self-contained on GitHub using GitHub pages and actions. The latter, is a full stack example using R (Plumber), Python (Flask) and NodeJS (ExpressJS) as backends. Please refer to each respository's README file for more.

### npm package
Current release is in beta for testing of the limited functionality and API offered by the codebase. The package is released under the same name "eatlas": https://www.npmjs.com/package/eatlas 

### Github Template repo
Please see the [Wiki entry](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/wiki/Using-TGVE) for details of how to host your own eAtlas using Github Pages.

### Development
To run the front end only without needs for the backend, having cloned the repo:

```{js}
npm i # or yarn
# and run
npm start
```

The frontend is a [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) (CRA) so all the standard commands of CRA appliees.

### R 
The whole application is a [geopumber](https://github.com/ATFutures/geoplumber) app. That means it is an R powered backend API (think Flask in Python) and a ReactJS front end.

To build the frontend, from an R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```

To run the app using `geoplumber`, tha front-end is built using `geoplumber` and therefore:

* (optional) TGVE will be looking for a Mapbox API key, having obtained a Mapbox API key in `.env.local` file using variable name: `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'API_KEY'`. This is based on `react-map-gl` dependency, please see this [documentation](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl/blob/master/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens.md) for more.

* change the `PRD_URL` in the `Constants.js` file to `localhost:8000`. Default value is `https://layik.github.io/eAtlas` for this repo to publish on GitHub pages.

Then you can run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_plumb()
```

visit `localhost:8000`

### Docker for production

Repo contains Dockerfile for production. Again remember to change the production URL.

```{sh, eval= FALSE}
# Dockerfile manages your npm/React build steps
# REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN is required but app should run
docker build -t eatlas .
# then bind plumber's default 8000 port to any of your choice
docker run -d -p 8000:8001 --name eatlas eatlas
````
Use your favourite document server (nginx for example) to proxy requets (watch out for a Wiki entry on this).

## Notes

This README is valid for beta (`1.0.x-beta.x`) releases and updated with changes.

There are some [notes](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/blob/master/notes/project_planning.md) to read. These are thoughts and background reading material as we take steps towards understanding what an "interdependent" eAtlas might be. Would it be "Turing Geovisualization Engine"?

## Funding

The project is led by Dr [Nik Lomax](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1064/dr-nik-lomax) and Dr [Roger Beecham](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1003/dr-roger-beecham) and funded by the EPSRC via the Alan Turing Institute AI for Science and Government Programme, Grant/Award Number: EP/T001569/1.
